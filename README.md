Data Structures
Arrays

Fixed-size sequential collections for storing elements of the same type.
Applications: Storing data, matrices, and basic algorithms.
Linked Lists

Linear data structures with dynamic memory allocation.
Types: Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists.
Stacks

LIFO (Last In, First Out) structure.
Applications: Function calls, undo operations, and parsing expressions.
Queues

FIFO (First In, First Out) structure.
Variants: Priority Queue, Circular Queue, and Deque.
Trees

Hierarchical structures for data storage and retrieval.
Types: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Heaps, Tries.
Graphs

Networks of nodes and edges.
Traversal Algorithms: Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS).
Hashing

Key-value mapping for efficient data retrieval.
Applications: Hash Tables, collision handling strategies (e.g., chaining, open addressing).
Algorithms
Sorting Algorithms

Techniques: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, etc.
Searching Algorithms

Methods: Linear Search, Binary Search.
Dynamic Programming (DP)

Optimization technique for solving problems by breaking them into subproblems.
Examples: Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence.
Greedy Algorithms

Solve problems by making the locally optimal choice.
Examples: Huffman Coding, Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim’s and Kruskal’s).
Divide and Conquer

Solve problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems.
Examples: Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
Graph Algorithms

Shortest Path: Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford.
MST: Prim’s, Kruskal’s.
Connectivity: Tarjan’s Algorithm.
